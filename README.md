# Overview

The first GitHub repository for the beginning GitHub programmer. This is a basic example of connecting a GitHub repository to Visual Studio Code. The code in a respository is a simple python print statement that prints "Hello World" when it runs. Also included is a gitignore file and this README file. 

This repository is a tutorial on how to create a basic gitHub repository, change the code in Visual Studio Code and then commit those changes to GitHub.

# Development Environment

The GitHub guide was very helpful in finding the right way to create the respository. This page also really helped clear up some terminology.

I used python for this repository.
